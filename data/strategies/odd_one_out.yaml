title: "Finding the Odd One Out"
is_free: true

what_is_it: |
  In odd one out questions, you're given a group of words and must find
  the one that doesn't belong with the others.

  The other words share something in common - a category, meaning,
  or characteristic - while one word is different.

  Example: apple, banana, carrot, orange
  Odd one out: carrot (it's a vegetable, the others are fruits)

approach:
  - "Step 1: Look at all the words and ask 'What could link them?'"
  - "Step 2: Find the common theme (category, meaning, letters, sounds)"
  - "Step 3: Identify which word DOESN'T fit that theme"
  - "Step 4: Double-check by confirming the others DO share the link"

common_mistakes:
  - "Picking a word that's different in an obvious but wrong way"
  - "Not considering ALL possible groupings"
  - "Missing subtle categories (e.g., all have double letters except one)"
  - "Overthinking when the answer is simple"

time_tips:
  - "Start by looking for obvious categories (animals, colours, etc.)"
  - "If no obvious category, look at word structure (letters, syllables)"
  - "Trust your first instinct if 4 words clearly group together"

category_types:
  - type: "Meaning/Category"
    example: "dog, cat, table, rabbit → table (not an animal)"
  - type: "Part of Speech"
    example: "run, jump, quickly, swim → quickly (adverb, not verb)"
  - type: "Word Structure"
    example: "book, look, cook, food → food (doesn't rhyme with -ook)"
  - type: "Number of Syllables"
    example: "cat, dog, elephant, rat → elephant (3 syllables vs 1)"

worked_examples:
  - question: "Which word is the odd one out?\npiano, violin, trumpet, drum, guitar"
    answer: "trumpet"
    walkthrough: |
      What do these have in common? They're all musical instruments.
      But what KIND of instruments?

      - piano: You press keys (strings inside) - STRING instrument
      - violin: You use a bow on strings - STRING instrument
      - trumpet: You blow into it - BRASS/WIND instrument ← DIFFERENT!
      - drum: You hit it - PERCUSSION... wait, let's reconsider

      Actually, let's group by how you play them:
      - piano, violin, guitar: All have STRINGS
      - drum: Hit with sticks
      - trumpet: Blow air

      The question might want: trumpet (only BRASS instrument)
      Or: drum (only PERCUSSION instrument)

      Most likely answer: trumpet (only wind instrument among string/percussion)

  - question: "Which word is the odd one out?\nred, blue, green, happy, yellow"

    walkthrough: |
      This one is straightforward:
      - red, blue, green, yellow: All COLOURS
      - happy: An EMOTION, not a colour ✓

      Answer: happy

  - question: "Which word is the odd one out?\nbook, look, cook, food, hook"

    walkthrough: |

      - book: ends in -ook
      - look: ends in -ook
      - cook: ends in -ook
      - food: ends in -ood ← DIFFERENT!
      - hook: ends in -ook

      Answer: food (different spelling pattern)
