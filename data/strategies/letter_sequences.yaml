what_is_it: |
  Letter sequence questions show you a pattern of letters and ask you
  to find what comes next or to fill in a missing letter.

  These test your ability to spot patterns - just like number sequences
  but with letters of the alphabet instead.

  Example: A, C, E, G, ? → Answer: I (every other letter)

approach:
  - "Step 1: Write out the alphabet position of each letter (A=1, B=2...)"
  - "Step 2: Look for the pattern in the numbers"
  - "Step 3: Apply the pattern to find the next number"
  - "Step 4: Convert back to a letter"

common_mistakes:
  - "Not converting to numbers first"
  - "Missing patterns that skip letters (every 2nd, every 3rd)"
  - "Forgetting the alphabet has only 26 letters"
  - "Looking for complex patterns when it's simple"

time_tips:
  - "Write A-Z with numbers 1-26 at the top of your paper before starting"
  - "Look for common patterns: +1, +2, +3, alternating"
  - "If stuck, work backwards from the answers"

pattern_types:
  - type: "Constant Gap"
    example: "A, C, E, G (gap of 2 each time)"
  - type: "Increasing Gap"
    example: "A, B, D, G, K (gaps: 1, 2, 3, 4)"
  - type: "Alternating"
    example: "A, Z, B, Y, C, X (forwards and backwards)"
  - type: "Two Sequences"
    example: "A, M, B, N, C, O (two separate patterns mixed)"

worked_examples:
  - question: "What comes next? B, D, F, H, ?"
    options: ["I", "J", "K", "L"]
    answer: "J"
    walkthrough: |
      Convert to numbers:
      - B = 2
      - D = 4
      - F = 6
      - H = 8

      Pattern: +2 each time (2, 4, 6, 8...)
      Next: 8 + 2 = 10

      Letter 10 = J ✓

  - question: "What comes next? Z, X, V, T, ?"
    options: ["S", "R", "Q", "P"]
    answer: "R"
    walkthrough: |
      Convert to numbers:
      - Z = 26
      - X = 24
      - V = 22
      - T = 20

      Pattern: -2 each time (going backwards through alphabet)
      Next: 20 - 2 = 18

      Letter 18 = R ✓

  - question: "What comes next? A, B, D, G, ?"
    options: ["J", "K", "L", "M"]
    answer: "K"
    walkthrough: |
      Convert to numbers:
      - A = 1
      - B = 2 (gap: +1)
      - D = 4 (gap: +2)
      - G = 7 (gap: +3)

      Pattern: The GAP increases by 1 each time!
      - 1 → 2 (+1)
      - 2 → 4 (+2)
      - 4 → 7 (+3)
      - 7 → ? (+4) = 11

      Letter 11 = K ✓

  - question: "Fill in the missing letter: A, C, ?, G, I"
    answer: "E"
    walkthrough: |
      Convert: A=1, C=3, ?=?, G=7, I=9

      Pattern: 1, 3, ?, 7, 9 → gaps of 2

      Missing number: 3 + 2 = 5
      Letter 5 = E ✓
