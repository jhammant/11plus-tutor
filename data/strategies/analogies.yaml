  Analogies test your ability to see relationships between words.
  The format is: "A is to B as C is to ?"

  You need to identify the relationship between the first pair,
  then apply that same relationship to find the answer.

  Example: "Cat is to kitten as dog is to puppy"
  Relationship: Adult animal → Baby animal

approach:
  - "Step 1: Identify the relationship in the first pair"
  - "Step 2: Put it into words: 'A is the ___ of B'"
  - "Step 3: Apply the same relationship to the second pair"
  - "Step 4: Check your answer fits the pattern exactly"

common_mistakes:
  - "Focusing on surface similarities instead of relationships"
  - "Not identifying the EXACT relationship"
  - "Picking an answer that's related but doesn't match the pattern"
  - "Reversing the relationship direction"

time_tips:
  - "Spend 5 seconds identifying the relationship clearly"
  - "If stuck, try each answer and see which fits best"
  - "Common relationships: opposites, part-whole, size, category"

relationship_types:
  - type: "Synonyms"
    example: "big : large :: small : tiny"
  - type: "Antonyms"
    example: "hot : cold :: up : down"
  - type: "Part to Whole"
    example: "finger : hand :: toe : foot"
  - type: "Category"
    example: "apple : fruit :: carrot : vegetable"
  - type: "Degree/Size"
    example: "warm : hot :: cool : cold"
  - type: "Function"
    example: "pen : write :: knife : cut"
  - type: "Cause & Effect"
    example: "rain : wet :: sun : dry"

worked_examples:
  - question: "Glove is to hand as sock is to ?"
    options: ["arm", "leg", "foot", "shoe"]
    answer: "foot"
    walkthrough: |
      Step 1: What's the relationship?
      - A glove covers/protects a hand
      - A glove is worn ON the hand

      Step 2: Apply to sock:
      - What does a sock cover/protect?
      - What is a sock worn ON?
      - Answer: foot ✓

      Why not "shoe"? A shoe is worn over a sock, but it's not what
      the sock covers directly.

  - question: "Book is to read as food is to ?"
    options: ["cook", "eat", "buy", "taste"]
    answer: "eat"
    walkthrough: |
      Step 1: Relationship between book and read?
      - You READ a book (that's its primary purpose/use)
      - Book → action you do with it

      Step 2: What do you DO with food?
      - The primary action with food is to EAT it

      Why not "cook"? Not all food is cooked, but all food is eaten.
      Why not "taste"? Tasting is part of eating, but eating is the main action.

  - question: "Bird is to nest as bee is to ?"
    options: ["honey", "flower", "hive", "sting"]
    answer: "hive"
    walkthrough: |
      Step 1: What's a nest to a bird?
      - A nest is where a bird LIVES/makes its home

      Step 2: Where does a bee live?
      - A bee lives in a hive ✓

      Why not "honey"? Bees make honey, but that's not where they live.
      Why not "flower"? Bees visit flowers, but don't live there.
