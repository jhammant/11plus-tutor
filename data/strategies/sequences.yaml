what_is_it: |
  Number sequence questions show you a series of numbers following a
  pattern. You need to work out the rule and find the next number(s)
  or a missing number in the sequence.

  Example: 2, 4, 6, 8, ? → Answer: 10 (adding 2 each time)

approach:
  - "Step 1: Look at the differences between consecutive numbers"
  - "Step 2: If differences are constant, you have an arithmetic sequence"
  - "Step 3: If differences change, look for a pattern in the differences"
  - "Step 4: Check for multiplication/division patterns too"
  - "Step 5: Verify your rule works for ALL numbers in the sequence"

common_mistakes:
  - "Only looking at the first few numbers"
  - "Missing patterns where the rule changes (e.g., +1, +2, +3...)"
  - "Assuming it's always addition when it might be multiplication"
  - "Not checking your answer works for the whole sequence"

time_tips:
  - "Write out the differences between each pair of numbers"
  - "If differences aren't constant, find differences of differences"
  - "Look for common patterns: doubling, squares, triangular numbers"

pattern_types:
  - type: "Arithmetic (constant difference)"
    example: "3, 7, 11, 15, 19... (always +4)"
  - type: "Geometric (constant ratio)"
    example: "2, 6, 18, 54... (always ×3)"
  - type: "Increasing difference"
    example: "1, 2, 4, 7, 11... (differences: +1, +2, +3, +4)"
  - type: "Square numbers"
    example: "1, 4, 9, 16, 25... (1², 2², 3², 4², 5²)"
  - type: "Fibonacci-like"
    example: "1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... (each = sum of previous two)"

worked_examples:
  - question: "What comes next? 5, 11, 17, 23, ?"
    answer: "29"
    walkthrough: |
      Find the differences:
      - 11 - 5 = 6
      - 17 - 11 = 6
      - 23 - 17 = 6

      Constant difference of +6!
      Next: 23 + 6 = 29 ✓

  - question: "What comes next? 3, 6, 12, 24, ?"
    answer: "48"
    walkthrough: |
      Find the differences:
      - 6 - 3 = 3
      - 12 - 6 = 6
      - 24 - 12 = 12

      Differences aren't constant. Let's check for multiplication:
      - 6 ÷ 3 = 2
      - 12 ÷ 6 = 2
      - 24 ÷ 12 = 2

      Pattern: ×2 each time (doubling!)
      Next: 24 × 2 = 48 ✓

  - question: "What comes next? 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, ?"
    answer: "17"
    walkthrough: |
      Find the differences:
      - 3 - 2 = 1
      - 5 - 3 = 2
      - 8 - 5 = 3
      - 12 - 8 = 4

      The differences are increasing: 1, 2, 3, 4...
      Next difference: 5
      Next number: 12 + 5 = 17 ✓

  - question: "Find the missing number: 1, 4, ?, 16, 25"
    answer: "9"
    walkthrough: |
      Look at the numbers: 1, 4, ?, 16, 25

      These look like square numbers!
      - 1 = 1²
      - 4 = 2²
      - ? = 3² = 9
      - 16 = 4²
      - 25 = 5²

      Answer: 9 ✓

  - question: "What comes next? 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ?"
    answer: "13"
    walkthrough: |
      This is the Fibonacci sequence!
      Each number = sum of the previous two numbers.

      - 1 + 1 = 2 ✓
      - 1 + 2 = 3 ✓
      - 2 + 3 = 5 ✓
      - 3 + 5 = 8 ✓
      - 5 + 8 = 13 ✓

      Answer: 13
