what_is_it: |
  Arithmetic questions test your ability to work with numbers - adding,
  subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. In 11+ exams, you often need
  to do these calculations quickly in your head or with minimal working.

  These questions also test order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and
  your number sense.

approach:
  - "Step 1: Read the question carefully - what operation is needed?"
  - "Step 2: Look for shortcuts (rounding, breaking numbers apart)"
  - "Step 3: Estimate first to check your answer makes sense"
  - "Step 4: Double-check by working backwards if time allows"

common_mistakes:
  - "Forgetting order of operations (BIDMAS)"
  - "Making silly errors when rushing"
  - "Not estimating to check answers"
  - "Misreading the question (e.g., adding when should subtract)"

time_tips:
  - "Practice times tables until they're automatic"
  - "Learn to break numbers apart: 47 × 6 = (50 × 6) - (3 × 6)"
  - "Round and adjust: 198 + 45 ≈ 200 + 45 - 2 = 243"

mental_math_tricks:
  - trick: "Multiplying by 9"
    method: "Multiply by 10, then subtract the original number"
    example: "9 × 7 = 10 × 7 - 7 = 70 - 7 = 63"
  - trick: "Multiplying by 11"
    method: "For 2-digit numbers: split and add"
    example: "11 × 36: 3_(3+6)_6 = 396"
  - trick: "Squaring numbers ending in 5"
    method: "Multiply first digit by (first digit + 1), append 25"
    example: "35² = 3×4 = 12, append 25 = 1225"

worked_examples:
  - question: "Calculate: 156 + 287"
    answer: "443"
    walkthrough: |
      Method 1 (Column addition):
        156
      + 287
      -----
        443  (6+7=13, carry 1; 5+8+1=14, carry 1; 1+2+1=4)

      Method 2 (Mental - round and adjust):
      287 is close to 300
      156 + 300 = 456
      But we added 13 too many (300-287=13)
      456 - 13 = 443 ✓

  - question: "Calculate: 24 × 25"
    answer: "600"
    walkthrough: |
      Shortcut: 25 = 100 ÷ 4

      So 24 × 25 = 24 × 100 ÷ 4
                 = 2400 ÷ 4
                 = 600 ✓

      Alternative: 24 × 25 = 6 × 4 × 25 = 6 × 100 = 600

  - question: "What is 15% of 80?"
    answer: "12"
    walkthrough: |
      Method 1: 15% = 10% + 5%
      - 10% of 80 = 8
      - 5% of 80 = 4 (half of 10%)
      - 15% = 8 + 4 = 12 ✓

      Method 2: 15% = 15/100 = 3/20
      80 × 3/20 = 240/20 = 12 ✓

  - question: "Calculate: 8 + 4 × 3 - 6 ÷ 2"
    answer: "17"
    walkthrough: |
      Remember BIDMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division/Multiplication, Addition/Subtraction

      8 + 4 × 3 - 6 ÷ 2
      = 8 + (4 × 3) - (6 ÷ 2)    [do × and ÷ first]
      = 8 + 12 - 3
      = 20 - 3
      = 17 ✓
