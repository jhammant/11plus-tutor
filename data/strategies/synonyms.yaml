what_is_it: |
  Synonyms are words that have the same or very similar meanings.
  In 11+ exams, you're given two groups of words and must find one word
  from each group that mean the same thing.

  Example: "happy" and "joyful" are synonyms - they both describe
  a positive, pleased feeling.

approach:
  - "Read both groups of words carefully - don't rush"
  - "Look for words that could replace each other in a sentence"
  - "Test your answer: 'The [word1] child' = 'The [word2] child'"
  - "If stuck, eliminate pairs that are clearly different"
  - "Watch out for words that sound similar but mean different things"

common_mistakes:
  - "Confusing synonyms with antonyms (opposites)"
  - "Picking words that sound alike but have different meanings"
  - "Not checking ALL possible pairs before answering"
  - "Rushing and missing the obvious answer"

time_tips:
  - "Aim for 20-30 seconds per question"
  - "If you can't find it in 30 seconds, mark and move on"
  - "Come back to tricky ones at the end"

worked_examples:
  - question: "Find two words, one from each group, that are closest in meaning.\n(big, small, tiny) (large, medium, little)"
    answer: "big & large"
    walkthrough: |
      Let's check each option systematically:
      - big & large: Both mean 'of great size' ✓ MATCH!
      - big & medium: Medium is middle-sized, not the same
      - small & large: These are opposites
      - tiny & little: Both mean 'very small' - but they're in the SAME group!

      The answer is big & large - they're synonyms meaning 'of great size'.

  - question: "Find the synonym pair: (quick, slow, steady) (fast, careful, lazy)"
    answer: "quick & fast"
    walkthrough: |
      - quick means 'moving rapidly' or 'done in a short time'
      - fast means the same thing
      - slow is the opposite of quick
      - steady means 'regular, unchanging' - different meaning
      - careful and lazy don't match any words in the first group

      Answer: quick & fast

  - question: "Find the synonym pair: (ancient, modern, recent) (old, new, current)"
    answer: "ancient & old"
    walkthrough: |
      - ancient means 'very old, from long ago'
      - old means 'having existed for a long time'
      - These are synonyms! Both describe things from the past.
      - modern & new would also be synonyms, but let's check...
      - modern is in group 1, new is in group 2 - but ancient & old is the closest match
      - recent & current are also similar but ancient & old is the clearest pair
