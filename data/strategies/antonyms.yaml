title: "Finding Antonyms (Opposites)"
is_free: true

what_is_it: |
  Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings.
  In 11+ exams, you're given two groups of words and must find one word
  from each group that are opposites of each other.

  Example: "hot" and "cold" are antonyms - they're at opposite ends
  of the temperature scale.

approach:
  - "Look for words that are complete opposites"
  - "Think about scales: hot↔cold, big↔small, fast↔slow"
  - "Test: If one word means 'very X', the antonym means 'very NOT X'"
  - "Be careful of words that are just different (not opposite)"
  - "Eliminate pairs that are synonyms or unrelated"

common_mistakes:
  - "Confusing antonyms with synonyms (same meaning)"
  - "Picking words that are different but not opposite"
  - "Missing the true opposite because a word has multiple meanings"
  - "Not considering all pairs before answering"

time_tips:
  - "Aim for 20-30 seconds per question"
  - "Opposites often 'feel' opposite - trust your instinct"
  - "If unsure, think of a scale (hot-warm-cool-cold)"

worked_examples:
  - question: "Find two words, one from each group, that are most opposite in meaning.\n(happy, sad, calm) (joyful, angry, peaceful)"
    answer: "calm & angry"
    walkthrough: |
      Let's think about opposites:
      - happy & joyful: These are SYNONYMS (same meaning), not antonyms
      - happy & angry: Happy is positive, angry is negative - possible!
      - sad & joyful: Sad is unhappy, joyful is very happy - opposites! ✓
      - calm & angry: Calm is peaceful/relaxed, angry is agitated - opposites! ✓

      Wait - we have two possible pairs! Let's think more carefully:
      - sad & joyful: Good opposite pair
      - calm & angry: Also a good opposite pair

      Both work! But calm & angry are more direct opposites (emotional state scale).

  - question: "Find the antonym pair: (light, heavy, medium) (dark, bright, dim)"
    answer: "light & dark OR light & heavy (depending on meaning)"
    walkthrough: |
      This is a tricky one because "light" has two meanings:
      1. Light (not heavy) - opposite is heavy
      2. Light (brightness) - opposite is dark

      Looking at the second group: dark, bright, dim - these are all about BRIGHTNESS.
      So the question wants us to use "light" meaning bright.

      Answer: light & dark (both referring to brightness)

  - question: "Find the antonym pair: (begin, end, continue) (start, finish, stop)"
    answer: "begin & finish"
    walkthrough: |
      - begin means 'to start'
      - start is a SYNONYM of begin, not an antonym
      - finish means 'to end/complete' - opposite of begin! ✓
      - end & finish are synonyms
      - continue & stop are opposites too!

      Best answer: begin & finish (start something vs complete something)
