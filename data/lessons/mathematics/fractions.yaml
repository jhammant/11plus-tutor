is_free: true

explanation: |
  Fractions represent parts of a whole. Understanding fractions is crucial for the 11+ exam as they appear in many question types.

  A fraction has two parts:
  - NUMERATOR (top number): How many parts you have
  - DENOMINATOR (bottom number): How many equal parts the whole is divided into

  For example, 3/4 means "3 out of 4 equal parts"

  KEY CONCEPTS:

  Equivalent fractions: Different fractions that represent the same amount
  - 1/2 = 2/4 = 4/8 = 50/100
  - Multiply or divide both top and bottom by the same number

  Simplifying fractions: Reducing to lowest terms
  - 8/12 = 2/3 (divide both by 4)
  - Find the highest common factor (HCF)

  Comparing fractions: Which is bigger?
  - Same denominator: Compare numerators (3/8 < 5/8)
  - Different denominators: Find common denominator first

  Mixed numbers and improper fractions:
  - Mixed number: 2 3/4 (two and three-quarters)
  - Improper fraction: 11/4 (numerator bigger than denominator)

key_points:
  - To add/subtract fractions, they must have the SAME denominator
  - To multiply fractions, multiply top x top and bottom x bottom
  - To divide fractions, flip the second fraction and multiply
  - Always simplify your final answer
  - Know common fraction-decimal-percentage conversions

common_mistakes:
  - Adding denominators when adding fractions (wrong!)
  - Forgetting to find a common denominator before adding
  - Not simplifying the final answer
  - Confusing mixed numbers with improper fractions
  - Forgetting to flip when dividing fractions

tips:
  - Learn common equivalent fractions (1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 = 4/8)
  - Know fraction-decimal conversions (1/2 = 0.5, 1/4 = 0.25)
  - Draw pictures to visualize fraction problems
  - Always check if your answer can be simplified

worked_examples:
  - question: "Calculate 2/5 + 1/3"
    answer: "11/15"
    explanation: |
      Step 1: Find common denominator
      - LCM of 5 and 3 is 15

      Step 2: Convert fractions
      - 2/5 = 6/15 (multiply top and bottom by 3)
      - 1/3 = 5/15 (multiply top and bottom by 5)

      Step 3: Add numerators
      - 6/15 + 5/15 = 11/15

      The answer 11/15 cannot be simplified further.

  - question: "Calculate 3/4 x 2/5"
    answer: "3/10"
    explanation: |
      To multiply fractions:
      - Multiply numerators: 3 x 2 = 6
      - Multiply denominators: 4 x 5 = 20
      - Result: 6/20

      Simplify: 6/20 = 3/10 (divide both by 2)

  - question: "Which is larger: 3/5 or 5/8?"
    answer: "5/8"
    explanation: |
      Find a common denominator (LCM of 5 and 8 is 40):
      - 3/5 = 24/40 (multiply by 8)
      - 5/8 = 25/40 (multiply by 5)

      Compare: 25/40 > 24/40
      Therefore 5/8 > 3/5
