  Arithmetic is the foundation of all mathematics. In the 11+ exam, you'll need to be confident with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - often in your head or with quick written methods.

  The four basic operations:

  ADDITION (+): Combining numbers together
  - 145 + 78 = 223
  - Tip: Add in columns, starting from the right (units first)

  SUBTRACTION (-): Taking one number away from another
  - 523 - 187 = 336
  - Tip: Borrow from the next column when needed

  MULTIPLICATION (x): Adding a number to itself multiple times
  - 24 x 7 = 168
  - Tip: Know your times tables up to 12 x 12

  DIVISION (/): Splitting a number into equal parts
  - 156 / 12 = 13
  - Tip: Use times tables in reverse

  Mental math shortcuts can save valuable time in the exam!

key_points:
  - Know your times tables fluently (up to 12 x 12)
  - Practice mental addition and subtraction
  - Learn to estimate answers to check your work
  - Use place value (hundreds, tens, units) to break down problems
  - BIDMAS/BODMAS for order of operations (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction)

common_mistakes:
  - Forgetting to carry over in addition
  - Errors when borrowing in subtraction
  - Times tables mistakes (especially 7s, 8s, 9s)
  - Not checking if an answer makes sense
  - Ignoring the order of operations

tips:
  - Practice times tables daily until they're automatic
  - Use estimation to check answers (is 47 x 8 closer to 400 or 40?)
  - Break big numbers into smaller parts (67 x 4 = 60x4 + 7x4 = 240 + 28 = 268)
  - Double and halve for quick multiplication (25 x 16 = 50 x 8 = 400)

worked_examples:
  - question: "Calculate 347 + 285"
    answer: "632"
    explanation: |
      Step by step:
      1. Units: 7 + 5 = 12, write 2, carry 1
      2. Tens: 4 + 8 + 1 = 13, write 3, carry 1
      3. Hundreds: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
      Answer: 632

  - question: "Calculate 45 x 12"
    answer: "540"
    explanation: |
      Method 1 - Split the multiplier:
      45 x 12 = 45 x 10 + 45 x 2
      = 450 + 90 = 540

      Method 2 - Double and multiply:
      45 x 12 = 45 x 4 x 3
      = 180 x 3 = 540

  - question: "Calculate 864 / 8"
    answer: "108"
    explanation: |
      Think: How many 8s go into each part?
      800 / 8 = 100
      64 / 8 = 8
      Total: 100 + 8 = 108

      Check: 108 x 8 = 864 (correct!)
