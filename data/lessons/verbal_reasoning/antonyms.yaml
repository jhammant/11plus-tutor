title: Understanding Antonyms
is_free: true

explanation: |
  Antonyms are words that have opposite meanings. While synonyms are words that mean the same thing, antonyms are words that mean the complete opposite.

  In the 11+ exam, you'll need to identify pairs of words that are opposites from two groups of words.

  For example:
  - "hot" and "cold" are antonyms - temperature opposites
  - "up" and "down" are antonyms - direction opposites
  - "happy" and "sad" are antonyms - emotion opposites

  Understanding antonyms helps you build a richer vocabulary and shows you understand the full meaning of words, including what they are NOT.

key_points:
  - Antonyms are words with OPPOSITE meanings
  - Think about the category (size, emotion, direction, time)
  - Some words have multiple antonyms depending on context
  - Prefixes often create antonyms (happy/unhappy, possible/impossible)
  - Read all options carefully before selecting

common_mistakes:
  - Confusing antonyms with synonyms (picking words that mean the same)
  - Picking words that are just different, not opposite
  - Forgetting that some words need context to find their opposite
  - Missing prefix-based antonyms (like un-, dis-, in-, im-)

tips:
  - Think "What is the complete opposite of this word?"
  - Look for word families with opposite prefixes
  - Consider if the words are on opposite ends of a scale
  - Practice with common antonym pairs

worked_examples:
  - question: "Find the two words that are most opposite in meaning: (love, like, enjoy) (hate, dislike, prefer)"
    answer: "love & hate"
    explanation: "'Love' and 'hate' are the strongest opposites - they represent the extreme ends of feelings towards something or someone. 'Like/dislike' are also opposites but weaker in intensity. 'Enjoy' and 'prefer' aren't really opposites of anything in the other group."

  - question: "Find the two words that are most opposite in meaning: (ancient, modern, old) (new, young, fresh)"
    answer: "ancient & modern"
    explanation: "'Ancient' means extremely old, from long ago. 'Modern' means current, up-to-date, or recent. These are clear opposites referring to time periods. While 'old/new' and 'old/young' are also opposite pairs, 'ancient/modern' are the most directly opposite."

  - question: "Find the two words that are most opposite in meaning: (generous, careful, brave) (mean, careless, cowardly)"
    answer: "brave & cowardly"
    explanation: "'Brave' means showing courage and not being afraid to face danger. 'Cowardly' means lacking courage and being afraid. These are perfect antonyms. Note that 'generous/mean' and 'careful/careless' are also opposite pairs - all three are valid, but you should identify the clearest pair."
