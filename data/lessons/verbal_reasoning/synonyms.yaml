explanation: |
  Synonyms are words that have the same or very similar meanings. Learning synonyms is essential for the 11+ exam because it tests your vocabulary and ability to recognize relationships between words.

  In the exam, you'll typically see two groups of words and need to find the pair that are synonyms (mean the same thing).

  For example:
  - "happy" and "joyful" are synonyms - both describe feeling pleased
  - "big" and "large" are synonyms - both describe great size
  - "fast" and "quick" are synonyms - both describe high speed

  Building a strong vocabulary is the key to success with synonym questions. The more words you know, the easier it becomes to spot the matching pairs.

key_points:
  - Synonyms are words with the SAME or SIMILAR meanings
  - Read ALL words in both groups before deciding
  - Look for words that could replace each other in a sentence
  - Some words have multiple meanings - think about context
  - Build your vocabulary by reading widely

common_mistakes:
  - Confusing synonyms with antonyms (words with opposite meanings)
  - Picking words that sound similar but mean different things (e.g., "affect" vs "effect")
  - Rushing and not reading all the options
  - Forgetting that words can have multiple meanings

tips:
  - Try substituting one word for another in a sentence - if it works, they're likely synonyms
  - Group words by theme (size words, emotion words, movement words)
  - Keep a vocabulary notebook of new words you learn

worked_examples:
  - question: "Find the two words that are closest in meaning: (angry, sad, happy) (furious, joyful, calm)"
    answer: "angry & furious"
    explanation: "Both 'angry' and 'furious' describe feeling very upset or mad about something. 'Furious' is actually a stronger form of 'angry'. The other pairs don't match: 'sad' doesn't match any word in the second group that closely, and while 'happy' and 'joyful' are similar, 'angry/furious' is the closest match."

  - question: "Find the two words that are closest in meaning: (begin, finish, middle) (end, start, centre)"
    answer: "begin & start"
    explanation: "Both 'begin' and 'start' mean to commence or initiate something. You might also notice 'finish/end' and 'middle/centre' are pairs, but the question asks for the closest match. 'Begin' and 'start' are almost perfectly interchangeable."

  - question: "Find the two words that are closest in meaning: (small, large, medium) (tiny, huge, average)"
    answer: "small & tiny"
    explanation: "Both 'small' and 'tiny' describe something of little size. 'Tiny' is actually more extreme than 'small', but they're still the closest synonyms. 'Large/huge' are also synonyms, as are 'medium/average', but 'small/tiny' is the best match because they describe the same concept most directly."
