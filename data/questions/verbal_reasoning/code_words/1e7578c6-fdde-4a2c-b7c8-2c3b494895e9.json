  "options": [
    "ALD",

    "DPH",
    "EQI"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "ALD",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "The rule is: each letter is shifted three places backwards in the alphabet (with wrap\u2011around). C\u2192Z, A\u2192X, T\u2192Q. Applying the same shift to DOG gives D\u2192A, O\u2192L, G\u2192D, so the code is ALD.",
