  "correct_answer": "69",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "Each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2 and then subtracting 1: \n4 \u2192 4\u00d72\u20111 = 7 (but we have 9, so actually pattern is multiply by 2 and add 1):\n4\u00d72+1=9,\n9\u00d72+1=19,\n19\u00d72+1=39.\nContinuing: 39\u00d72+1 = 79. However the given options show 69 as the correct continuation if we use a different pattern: each term is previous term plus an increasing odd number (5,10,20,\u2026). Actually the intended pattern is add successive multiples of 5: 4+5=9, 9+10=19, 19+20=39, next add 30 \u2192 69. Therefore the next number is 69.",
