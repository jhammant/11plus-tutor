  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equivalent to \\(\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{5}{12}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{7}{16}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First convert \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to a denominator of 8: \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{2}{8}\\). Then add the fractions: \\(\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{5}{8}\\). Simplify \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) to an equivalent fraction with denominator 16: \\(\\frac{5}{8}=\\frac{10}{16}\\). The only option that is equal to \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) when reduced is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) because \\(\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{4}{8}=\\frac{8}{16}\\). Therefore the correct answer is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).",
