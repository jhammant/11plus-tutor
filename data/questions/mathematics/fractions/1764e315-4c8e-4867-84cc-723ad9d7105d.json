  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equivalent to \\(\\frac{3}{8} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\frac{5}{8}",
    "\\frac{7}{12}",
    "\\frac{2}{3}",
    "\\frac{3}{5}",
    "\\frac{1}{2}"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\frac{5}{8}",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First convert \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to a fraction with denominator 8: \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{2}{8}\\). Then add the fractions: \\(\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{5}{8}\\). Therefore the equivalent fraction is \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), which is option 0.",
