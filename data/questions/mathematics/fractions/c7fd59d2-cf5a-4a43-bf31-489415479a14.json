  "question_text": "Calculate the result of subtracting \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) from \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). Which fraction is equivalent to the answer?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{5}{12}\\)",

  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). The least common multiple of 4 and 6 is 12.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n- \\(\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3 \\times 3}{4 \\times 3} = \\frac{9}{12}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{6 \\,\\times 2} = \\frac{2}{12}\\)\n\nNow subtract:\n\\[ \\frac{9}{12} - \\frac{2}{12} = \\frac{7}{12}. \\]\n\nSo the answer is \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\), which corresponds to option 0.",
