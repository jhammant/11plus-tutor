  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "What is the simplest form of the fraction that results from adding \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First, write the fractions with a common denominator. The least common denominator of 8 and 4 is 8.\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{2}{8} \\]\nNow add:\n\\[ \\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{5}{8}. \\]\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) is already in its simplest form, so the correct answer is option 0.",
