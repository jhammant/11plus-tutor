  "correct_answer": "5/8",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First change the fractions to have a common denominator. The denominator 8 works for both: \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{2}{8}\\). Then add the numerators: \\(\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{5}{8}\\). Therefore the equivalent fraction is 5/8, which is option 0.",
