  "options": [
    "\\frac{1}{2}",
    "\\frac{1}{4}",

  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "To find an equivalent fraction, simplify \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3. \\(\\frac{3 \u00f7 3}{6 \u00f7 3} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) is equivalent to \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\).",
