  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "What is the simplest form of the fraction that results from adding \\(\\frac{3}{8}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\frac{5}{8}",
    "\\frac{7}{12}",
    "\\frac{2}{3}",
    "\\frac{3}{10}",
    "\\frac{1}{2}"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\frac{5}{8}",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First, convert \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to a fraction with denominator 8: \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{2}{8}\\). Then add the numerators: \\(\\frac{3}{8}+\\frac{2}{8}=\\frac{5}{8}\\). The fraction \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\) is already in its simplest form, so it is the correct answer.",
