  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which fraction is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) and is less than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\)"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First simplify \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\): both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2, so \\(\\frac{2 \u00f7 2}{6 \u00f7 2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\). \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) is less than \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) because \\(\\frac{1}{3}=0.333... < 0.5\\). Therefore the correct choice is the first option.",
