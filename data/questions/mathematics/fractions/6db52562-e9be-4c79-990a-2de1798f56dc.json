  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equal to \\(\\frac{3}{6} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First simplify \\(\\frac{3}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Convert both fractions to a common denominator, e.g., 4: \\(\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{2}{4}\\). Then add: \\(\\frac{2}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{4}\\). So the correct answer is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\).",
