  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\frac{5}{12}",
    "\\frac{7}{12}",
    "\\frac{3}{8}",
    "\\frac{2}{5}"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\frac{7}{12}",
  "correct_index": 1,
  "explanation": "First simplify \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\); the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. Convert: \\(\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{4}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{12}\\). Add them: \\(\\frac{4}{12}+\\frac{3}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}\\). The fraction \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) is therefore equivalent to the given sum.",
