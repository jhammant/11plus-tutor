  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "7/12",
    "5/8",
    "2/5",
    "3/7",
    "1/2"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "7/12",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First simplify the fractions where possible. \\(\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}\\). Now add \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). Find a common denominator: the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.\n\nConvert each fraction:\n- \\(\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{4}{12}\\)\n- \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{12}\\)\n\nAdd them: \\(\\frac{4}{12}+\\frac{3}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}\\).\n\nTherefore the fraction equivalent to the sum is \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\), which is option 0.",
