  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equivalent to \\(\\dfrac{3}{8} + \\dfrac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\dfrac{5}{8}\\)",
    "\\(\\dfrac{7}{12}\\)",
    "\\(\\dfrac{2}{3}\\)",
    "\\(\\dfrac{3}{10}\\)"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\dfrac{5}{8}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First convert \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}\\) to a denominator of 8: \\(\\dfrac{1}{4}=\\dfrac{2}{8}\\). Then add the fractions: \\(\\dfrac{3}{8}+\\dfrac{2}{8}=\\dfrac{5}{8}\\). The fraction \\(\\dfrac{5}{8}\\) is already in simplest form, so it is the correct answer.",
