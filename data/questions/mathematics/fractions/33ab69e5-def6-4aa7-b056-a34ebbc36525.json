  "question_text": "Calculate the sum of the fractions \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\). Choose the answer that is equivalent to the result in its simplest form.",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)",

    "\\(\\frac{3}{5}\\)",

  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First, simplify \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\); the least common multiple of 4 and 3 is 12. Convert: \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{4}{12}\\). Add them: \\(\\frac{3}{12}+\\frac{4}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}\\). The fraction \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) is already in its simplest form, so the correct answer is option 0.",
