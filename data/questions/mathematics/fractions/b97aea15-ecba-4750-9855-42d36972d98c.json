  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "What is the simplest form of the fraction that results from adding \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{3}{10}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{13}{24}\\)",
    "\\(\\frac{2}{5}\\)"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\(\\frac{7}{12}\\)",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First simplify \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\); the least common denominator is 12. Convert: \\(\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{4}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{12}\\). Add them: \\(\\frac{4}{12}+\\frac{3}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}\\). The fraction \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) is already in simplest form, so the correct answer is option 0.",
