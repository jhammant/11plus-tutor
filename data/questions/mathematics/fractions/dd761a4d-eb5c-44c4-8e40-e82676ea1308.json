  "question_text": "What is the sum of the fractions \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\)? Choose the equivalent fraction from the options below.",
  "options": [
    "1/2",
    "3/10",
    "7/10",
    "2/3",
    "1/4"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "1/2",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First, find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\). The least common multiple of 5 and 10 is 10.\n\nConvert \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\) to tenths: \\(\\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{4}{10}\\).\nNow add the fractions:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{10} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10}. \\]\nSimplify \\(\\frac{5}{10}\\) by dividing numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, 5:\n\\[ \\frac{5 \u00f7 5}{10 \u00f7 5} = \\frac{1}{2}. \\]\nTherefore, the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), which corresponds to option 0.",
