  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equal to \\(\\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "\\frac{7}{12}",
    "\\frac{5}{12}",
    "\\frac{3}{8}",
    "\\frac{2}{5}",
    "\\frac{1}{2}"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "\\frac{7}{12}",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First simplify \\(\\frac{2}{6}\\) to \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\); the least common denominator is 12. Convert: \\(\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{4}{12}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{12}\\). Add them: \\(\\frac{4}{12}+\\frac{3}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}\\). Therefore the correct answer is \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\).",
