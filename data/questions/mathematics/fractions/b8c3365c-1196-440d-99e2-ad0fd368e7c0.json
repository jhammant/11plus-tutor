  "difficulty": 3,
  "question_text": "Which of the following fractions is equivalent to \\(\\frac{2}{6} + \\frac{1}{4}\\)?",
  "options": [
    "7/12",
    "5/8",
    "3/10",
    "2/5"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "7/12",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First simplify the fractions: \\(\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}\\). Find a common denominator for \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\); the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12. Convert:\n\\[\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{4}{12}, \\quad \\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{12}.\\]\nAdd them: \\(\\frac{4}{12}+\\frac{3}{12}=\\frac{7}{12}.\\) The fraction \\(\\frac{7}{12}\\) is already in simplest form, so the correct answer is option 0.",
