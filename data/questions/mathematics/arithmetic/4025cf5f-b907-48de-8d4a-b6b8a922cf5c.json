  ],
  "correct_answer": "75",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First find how many novels and textbooks were ordered.\n- Novels: 25% of 120 = 0.25 \u00d7 120 = 30 novels.\n- Textbooks: 120 \u2013 30 = 90 textbooks.\nNow calculate how many are sold:\n- Half of the novels: 30 \u00f7 2 = 15 novels sold, leaving 30 \u2013 15 = 15 novels.\n- One\u2011third of the textbooks: 90 \u00f7 3 = 30 textbooks sold, leaving 90 \u2013 30 = 60 textbooks.\nAdd the remaining books: 15 novels + 60 textbooks = 75 books left.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 75.",
