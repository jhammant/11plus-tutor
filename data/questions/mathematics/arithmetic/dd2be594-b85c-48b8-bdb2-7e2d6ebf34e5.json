  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First find how many novels were bought: 1/4 of 120 = 30 novels. The remaining books are textbooks: 120 - 30 = 90 textbooks.\n\nThe school sold 30% of the novels: 0.30 \u00d7 30 = 9 novels sold. Novels left = 30 - 9 = 21.\n\nThey gave away 5 textbooks, so textbooks left = 90 - 5 = 85.\n\nTotal books remaining = novels left + textbooks left = 21 + 85 = 106.",
