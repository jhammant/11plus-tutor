  "question_text": "A school needs to buy 240 notebooks for an upcoming project. The notebooks are sold in packs of 12, and each pack costs $15. If the school buys more than 200 notebooks, they receive a 10% discount on the total price. How much will the school pay for the notebooks?",
  "options": [
    "270",
    "285",
    "300",
    "255",
    "260"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "270",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First find how many packs are needed: 240 \u00f7 12 = 20 packs. The regular cost is 20 \u00d7 $15 = $300. Because more than 200 notebooks are bought, a 10% discount applies: 10% of $300 = $30. Subtract the discount: $300 - $30 = $270. So the school pays $270.",
