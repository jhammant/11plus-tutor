  "question_text": "Liam buys three video games that each cost \u00a312 and a set of cards that originally costs \u00a38 but is sold with a 25% discount. What is the total amount Liam spends on these items?",
  "options": [
    "42",
    "38",
    "45",
    "40",
    "36"
  ],
  "correct_answer": "42",
  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First calculate the cost of the three video games: 3 \u00d7 \u00a312 = \u00a336.\nThe set of cards is discounted by 25%, so it costs 75% of \u00a38:\n0.75 \u00d7 \u00a38 = \u00a36.\nAdd the two amounts: \u00a336 + \u00a36 = \u00a342.\nTherefore, Liam spends \u00a342 in total.",
