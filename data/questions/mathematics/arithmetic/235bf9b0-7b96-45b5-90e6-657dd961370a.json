  "correct_index": 0,
  "explanation": "First find the total number of books: 3 \u00d7 24 = 72 books.\nCost before discount: 72 \u00d7 \u00a32.50 = \u00a3180.\nDiscount of 10%: 10% of \u00a3180 = \u00a318, so discounted price = \u00a3180 \u2013 \u00a318 = \u00a3162.\nThe school returns 12 books: 12 \u00d7 \u00a32.50 = \u00a330 refunded.\nFinal amount spent: \u00a3162 \u2013 \u00a330 = \u00a3132.",
