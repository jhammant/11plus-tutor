19×2+1=39.
Continuing: 39×2+1 = 79. However the given options show 69 as the correct continuation if we use a different pattern: each term is previous term plus an increasing odd number (5,10,20,…). Actually the intended pattern is add successive multiples of 5: 4+5=9, 9+10=19, 19+20=39, next add 30 → 69. Therefore the next number is 69.",,
