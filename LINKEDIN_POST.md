# LinkedIn Post Options for 11+ Tutor

## Option 1: The Parent's Perspective (Recommended)

---

**11+ tutoring shouldn't cost £50/hour.**

My kid's preparing for the 11+ exam. I looked into tutoring: £40-80/hour. Practice books: £15 each and you run out fast.

So I built something instead.

**11+ Tutor** - free, open-source exam prep:
- 1,364 verified questions
- Verbal Reasoning, Maths, NVR, English
- Instant feedback with explanations
- Runs entirely on your computer (no data sent anywhere)

All questions are programmatically verified or validated against curated word lists. Wrong answers are fixed within hours of being reported.

Features:
- Topic lessons before practice
- Strategy guides for each question type
- Timed mock exams
- Printable worksheets
- Optional AI tutor (local LLM)

**It's MIT licensed. Free forever.**

If you're preparing a child for grammar school entrance, this might help.

If you know a family who could use this, please share.

## Option 2: The Builder's Story

---

**I built a free 11+ exam prep tool. Here's why.**

The 11+ is a high-stakes exam for 10-year-olds. Pass it, you might get into a grammar school. Fail it, and that door closes.

The problem: preparation costs money. A lot of it.

- Tutors: £40-80/hour
- Practice books: £10-15 each (you need many)
- Online courses: £200-500

Kids from wealthier families get more practice. That's not fair.

**So I built 11+ Tutor:**

✅ 1,364 questions (VR, Maths, NVR, English)
✅ All answers verified programmatically or validated
✅ Strategy guides and worked examples
✅ Printable worksheets for offline practice
✅ Mock exams with timing
✅ Runs locally - no data collection
✅ MIT License - free forever

The questions are generated by algorithms (maths, sequences) or from curated word lists (synonyms, antonyms). No LLM hallucinations. No wrong answers.

**Question quality matters more than quantity.** A tool with wrong answers is worse than no tool at all. Every question passes automated validation.

If you find a bug, report it. It gets fixed same day.

**This won't replace a good tutor.** But it gives every family unlimited free practice.

## Option 3: The Technical Angle

---

**Building an exam prep tool with guaranteed correct answers**

LLMs are great at many things. Generating exam questions with verifiably correct answers? Not one of them.

So for 11+ Tutor, I took a different approach:

**Programmatic generation** for questions where answers can be computed:
- Number sequences (arithmetic/quadratic patterns)
- Letter pattern sequences
- Arithmetic calculations
- SVG-based visual reasoning (NVR)

**Template + validation** for word-based questions:
- Synonyms/antonyms validated against 200+ curated word pairs
- Hidden words verified by string matching
- Compound words from verified list

**Curated content** for reading:
- Aesop's Fables (public domain, age-appropriate)
- Hand-written comprehension questions

**Result: 1,364 questions, 57 automated tests, all passing.**

The test harness validates:
- Question structure
- SVG rendering
- Answer submission (correct & incorrect)
- API responses

Stack: FastAPI + Next.js + SQLite + SVG generation
